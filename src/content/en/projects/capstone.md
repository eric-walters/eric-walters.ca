## Overview

Landing Zones Canada is a Canadian aerospace company developing reusable remotely piloted aerial systems. Their GITPO RPAS is designed to replace the 20,000+ single-use radiosondes launched annually across Canada for atmospheric data collection. Unlike disposable radiosondes, the GITPO is carried to altitude by a weather balloon, released, and returns autonomously to its base for reuse.

Our capstone team of six mechanical engineering students was tasked with designing the balloon launch system for the GITPO. The system needed to manage the structural connection between the balloon tether and the airframe, control the release of the lift balloon at altitude, and ensure the drone was held at the correct orientation for a clean launch into autonomous flight.

## My Role

Team lead responsible for project direction, task delegation, client communication, and design integration. Managed the overall SolidWorks assembly and coordinated inputs from all team members. Communicated directly with Landing Zones throughout the semester to ensure the design met their operational requirements and aligned with the existing airframe. Oversaw simulation work conducted by teammates, reviewing FEA and CFD results and incorporating findings into design revisions.

## Scope and Deliverables

The final SolidWorks assembly comprised over 400 parts including weldments, smart fasteners, and subassemblies. The full deliverable package included ASME-compliant engineering drawings with a complete assembly guide, three technical reports covering design rationale, analysis results, and manufacturing recommendations, and the complete CAD model package for client hand-off. The project scope was limited to detailed design — no physical prototype was fabricated.
