## Vanaheim Infrastructure Platform

Self-hosted infrastructure platform built on Proxmox, running across multiple containers with segmented VLANs, centralized authentication, and automated service deployment through a git-based CI/CD pipeline.

Services include file storage, photo management, document management, password management, DNS ad-blocking, media hosting, and a local AI inference stack. Networking is handled through OPNsense with UniFi access points and managed switching. Reverse proxy and TLS termination through Caddy with Cloudflare DNS.

Hardware includes a ThinkStation P520 workstation, dedicated TrueNAS storage with ZFS mirroring, and custom 3D-printed rack components designed in SolidWorks and printed in-house.
